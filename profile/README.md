# What's Monkestation?
Monkestation is a Medium-Rare Roleplay [Space Station 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLAHBexJxrE) server (US based) run and developed by a bunch of chimps and led by [The Duke of Ook](https://twitch.tv/thedukeofook). You can learn more about the game on the [main website](https://monkestation.com/).

Monkestation is a family of 3 SS13 servers, listed below:
- [Monkestation2.0](https://github.com/Monkestation/Monkestation2.0/) - Based on [tgstation](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation) code, this is Monkestation, this is what it's all about. Previously, Monkestation was a [Beestation](https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/) fork, but we transitioned to Tgstation code around June of 2023. Monkestation is now it's own codebase and does not actively keep up to date with master tgstation.
- [Vanderlin](https://github.com/Monkestation/Vanderlin) - Based on [Stonekeep](https://github.com/Darkrp-community/OpenKeep/) code, Vanderlin is a Dark Medieval Fantasy codebase that's technically SS13 but it's not. (One of the few fantasy codebases that's not ERP)
- [Monkeris](https://github.com/Monkestation/Monkeris/) - A fork of [CEV: Eris](https://github.com/discordia-space/CEV-Eris/) repurposed to be modern and not horrible to play, primarily lead/developed by [@Mycah142](https://github.com/mycah142) and [@Flleeppyy](https://github.com/flleeppyy)
